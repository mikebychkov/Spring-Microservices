## Whilst config server registering as "config server" at eureka server takes more time than to start another
## eureka clients, services depending on config server crashing (at least when using @Value placeholders) for first time start.
## Conclusions:
## - not to use @Value placeholders
## - or use "restart: always" in docker-compose.yml with a service definition to make service try to restart if
##   config server not found
## - /actuator/refresh - also helps
##
